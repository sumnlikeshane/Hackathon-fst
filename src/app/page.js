                Digital addiction among Indian teenagers is a result of multiple interconnected elements within the socio-technical systemâ€”ranging from personal habits to platform design. The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a system disturbance, reinforcing existing feedback loops related to screen dependence by reducing access to offline engagement options.

            <p className="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              System behavior analysis reveals that although 60% of teens engage in screen use for more than three hours daily, only a fraction derive long-term satisfactionâ€”suggesting a reinforcing loop where screen exposure does not equate to emotional well-being. Uncovering these underlying dynamics is essential to identify effective leverage points for intervention.

              Digital addiction among Indian teenagers is a complex issue with multiple causes and consequences. The increasing screen time, coupled with the rise in mental health and social issues, calls for urgent action. While existing solutions like parental monitoring and digital literacy programs provide some relief, they are not sufficient on their own. A holistic approach that includes regulation of addictive platform features, promotion of offline activities, and enhanced mental health support offers the best chance to mitigate digital addiction in the long term.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              In conclusion, addressing digital addiction requires a multi-pronged approach involving the government, tech companies, educators, parents, and the teens themselves. Only by working together can we create a digital environment that supports the well-being of our future generation.
